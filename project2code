# 1. Plot the number of planes in the air over time?

    # GET /flights/all
    # counting loop
    # import matplotlib.pyplot as plt is needed i think

# 2. How many planes are in the air right now?

    # reference below, time is in unix time and should be changed to now
    # request date and time i think
    # counting loop again

# 3. What is the average altitude and speed of active planes?

    # GET /tracks
    # GET /states/all
    # altitude: baro_altitude OR geo_altitude
    # speed: velocity
    # code to quickly calculate average of both

# 4. Where are the flights concentrated right now?

    # get and calculate the average longitude and latitude?
    # we can also reference country: origin_country

# Make code to automate displayed data
    # pip install pandas
    # import pandas as pd
    # df = pd.read_csv('filename.csvâ€™)
